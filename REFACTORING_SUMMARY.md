# gtGMM v2.0 Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the major refactoring and enhancements made to the gtGMM package in version 2.0.

## Overview

The gtGMM package has undergone a comprehensive refactoring to create a clean, lightweight, and production-ready codebase. This refactoring incorporates all optimizations and enhancements developed during the cardiac regeneration analysis project, resulting in a more powerful and user-friendly package.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Package Structure

The package has been reorganized into a cleaner, more modular structure that follows Python best practices. The new structure separates concerns more effectively and makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.

**Before:**
```
src/gtgmm/
├── __init__.py
├── terrain.py
├── gmm_optimizer.py
├── tda.py
├── visualization.py
├── utils.py
├── geo_data.py
└── gse130699_data.py
```

**After:**
```
gtgmm/
├── __init__.py          # Enhanced with convenience functions
├── terrain.py           # Core GeneTerrain class
├── gmm.py              # GMM analysis (renamed from gmm_optimizer.py)
├── tda.py              # Topological data analysis
├── enrichment.py       # NEW: Pathway enrichment analysis
├── data.py             # NEW: Data loading and preprocessing
├── visualization.py    # Enhanced visualization tools
├── utils.py            # Utility functions
├── geo_data.py         # Geographic data utilities
└── gse130699_data.py   # GSE130699 dataset loader
```

### 2. New Modules

#### `enrichment.py`
A comprehensive pathway enrichment analysis module that provides:
- Fisher's exact test for statistical enrichment
- FDR correction using Benjamini-Hochberg method
- Component-level enrichment analysis
- Condition comparison capabilities

#### `data.py`
A data loading and preprocessing module that includes:
- `load_gse130699()` function for cardiac regeneration dataset
- `get_cardiac_pathways()` with 12 curated pathways
- Expression data filtering and normalization utilities
- Gene name validation

### 3. Enhanced API

The package now provides a cleaner, more intuitive API with high-level convenience functions:

```python
# Quick terrain creation with optimal settings
gt = gtgmm.create_terrain(genes, expression, species=10090)

# Complete regeneration analysis workflow
results = gtgmm.analyze_regeneration(genes_p1, expr_p1, genes_p8, expr_p8)
```

### 4. Optimizations

Several key optimizations have been integrated:

- **High-resolution terrains**: Default resolution changed to 500x500 for optimal balance
- **Adaptive GMM**: Automatic BIC-based component selection
- **Optimized sigma**: Automatic sigma optimization for terrain creation
- **Efficient TDA**: Improved topological calculations

### 5. Enhanced Features

#### GeneTerrain
- Improved `optimize_sigma()` with better defaults
- Added `get_terrain_data()` for easier GMM integration
- Better error handling for STRING API failures

#### GMMOptimizer
- Added `extract_gene_components()` method
- Enhanced optimization metrics
- Better convergence reporting

#### TerrainTDA
- Tighter integration with GeneTerrain
- Improved metric calculations
- More comprehensive summary output

#### TerrainVisualizer
- Publication-quality default settings
- Better colormap handling
- Enhanced plot customization

### 6. Documentation

The package now includes comprehensive documentation:

- **Sphinx documentation**: Full API reference with auto-generated docs
- **README**: Updated with v2.0 features and examples
- **CHANGELOG**: Detailed version history
- **Examples**: Comprehensive example scripts

### 7. Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been added:

- Unit tests for all major functionality
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Example scripts that serve as functional tests

## Migration Guide

For users upgrading from v1.0 to v2.0, here are the key changes:

### Import Changes

```python
# v1.0
from gtgmm import GeneTerrain, GMMOptimizer, TerrainTDA

# v2.0 (same, but with additional modules)
from gtgmm import GeneTerrain, GMMOptimizer, TerrainTDA, EnrichmentAnalyzer
from gtgmm import data  # New data module
```

### API Changes

```python
# v1.0
gt = GeneTerrain(genes, expression)
gt.fetch_string_interactions()
gt.compute_layout()
gt.create_terrain()

# v2.0 (can use convenience function)
gt = gtgmm.create_terrain(genes, expression)  # Does all of the above
```

### Default Parameters

- **Resolution**: Changed from 1000 to 500 (can still be customized)
- **GMM optimization**: Now enabled by default
- **Sigma optimization**: Now available as a standard method

## Performance Improvements

The refactored package shows significant performance improvements:

- **Faster terrain creation**: Optimized Gaussian kernel calculations
- **Better memory usage**: More efficient data structures
- **Improved scalability**: Better handling of large gene sets

## Quality Assurance

The refactored package includes:

- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation
- Informative error messages
- Extensive logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future versions:

- Additional pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome)
- Parallel processing for large-scale analyses
- Interactive visualization tools
- Integration with single-cell analysis frameworks

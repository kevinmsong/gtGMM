## Executive Summary

This delivery contains the completely refactored gtGMM package (version 2.0.0), incorporating all optimizations and enhancements developed during the cardiac regeneration analysis project. The package has been transformed into a clean, lightweight, and production-ready codebase suitable for broader distribution and use in the scientific community.

### Key Achievements

The refactored package successfully integrates the following major enhancements:

1. **High-resolution terrain generation** with default 500×500 resolution for optimal detail and performance balance
2. **Adaptive GMM optimization** using Bayesian Information Criterion for automatic component selection
3. **Comprehensive pathway enrichment analysis** with Fisher's exact test and FDR correction
4. **Seamless TerrainTDA integration** for topological data analysis
5. **Publication-quality visualizations** with optimized default settings
6. **Clean, intuitive API** with convenience functions for common workflows
7. **Complete documentation** including Sphinx-generated API references
8. **Comprehensive test suite** ensuring code quality and correctness

## Package Contents

### Core Modules

#### `gtgmm/terrain.py`
The central `GeneTerrain` class for creating and managing gene expression terrains. Enhanced with optimized sigma selection and better integration with other modules.

#### `gtgmm/gmm.py`
GMM analysis module (refactored from `gmm_optimizer.py`) with adaptive component selection and the new `extract_gene_components()` method for easier component-to-gene mapping.

#### `gtgmm/tda.py`
Topological data analysis module with comprehensive TDA metrics including Forman-Ricci curvature, Betti numbers, Euler characteristic, and persistence entropy.

#### `gtgmm/enrichment.py` (NEW)
Pathway enrichment analysis module providing statistical enrichment testing with Fisher's exact test and FDR correction. Supports both single gene sets and GMM component analysis.

#### `gtgmm/data.py` (NEW)
Data loading and preprocessing utilities including:
- `load_gse130699()` for cardiac regeneration dataset
- `get_cardiac_pathways()` with 12 curated pathways
- Expression filtering and normalization functions

#### `gtgmm/visualization.py`
Enhanced visualization tools for publication-quality figures, including 3D terrain plots, component maps, and enrichment visualizations.

## Installation and Testing

### Installation

```bash
cd gtGMM_refactored
pip install -e .
```

### Running Tests

```bash
python3 test_refactored_package.py
```

All tests should pass with the message "All tests passed! ✓"

### Running the Example

```bash
cd examples
python3 cardiac_regeneration_example.py
```

---

## API Highlights

### Quick Start Example

```python
import gtgmm

# Load data
genes, p1_expr, p8_expr = gtgmm.data.load_gse130699()

# Create terrain with optimal settings
gt_p1 = gtgmm.create_terrain(genes, p1_expr, species=10090)

# Run GMM and TDA
gmm = gtgmm.GMMOptimizer(max_components=8)
gmm.optimize(gt_p1.get_terrain_data(), min_components=3)

tda = gtgmm.TerrainTDA(gt_p1)
summary = tda.get_tda_summary()

# Pathway enrichment
pathways = gtgmm.data.get_cardiac_pathways()
enrichment = gtgmm.EnrichmentAnalyzer(pathways)
components = gmm.extract_gene_components(gt_p1)
results = enrichment.analyze_components(components, condition="P1")
```

### Convenience Functions

The package now includes high-level convenience functions:

- `gtgmm.create_terrain()`: Quick terrain creation with optimal defaults
- `gtgmm.analyze_regeneration()`: Complete cardiac regeneration workflow

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Repository Integration

The refactored code is ready to be committed to the gtGMM repository:

```bash
# From the gtGMM_refactored directory
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Version 2.0.0: Major refactoring with enhanced features"
git remote add origin https://github.com/kevinmsong/gtGMM.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Documentation Deployment

Build and deploy the Sphinx documentation:

```bash
cd docs
make html
# Deploy to GitHub Pages or Read the Docs
```

### 3. PyPI Publication (Optional)

For wider distribution, consider publishing to PyPI:

```bash
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
```

### 4. Testing with Real Data

Test the package with the complete GSE130699 dataset and the full 1,289-gene analysis from the cardiac regeneration project.
